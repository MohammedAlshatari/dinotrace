SUGGESTIONS

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

***CHECK part of contrib:

Display:

	Assign color to state changes.  For example, High=red, Low=blue,
	Z=black, or that type of thing.  Signal states are difficult to
	pick out in large trace files, and color would help. [Ted Steubing]

	Allow the user to associate a visual appearance with a value, just
	as you do with value names on buses. [Tim Leonard]

	STATE_ZU with U's of lower amplitute to show mixes of unknowns and
	tristates.
	
Diff:

	Have a method to display the difference between two trace-files,
	could be implemented by xoring two inputs and displaying the
	result.  [Paul Wasson]

Signal Selection:

	Allow hiearchy browsing.  Remap -> to ., then use . for hiearchy.

Keybindings:

	Bind cursor keys to something useful.  [Paul Wasson]

Time:	

	I'd also like the ability to "hide" time periods (much like you can
	hide signals).  This would allow me to ignore initialization stuff if
	it got captured (hide beginning to time n) or to hide junk after the
	problem area (from time n to end of time). [Steve Glaser]

	Have method of decoupling the multiple windows so one doesn't
	scroll with the other.  [Marco Zamora]
	
Value searches:

	Allow wildcards and symbolic state names in value searches.

Signal states:
       
	Limiting to 128 is problematic, especially with one-hot machines.
	[Glenn Garvey]

	Can you allow wildcarding (in bin) for signal states? [Mike Kagen]
	signal_states *->*CPM*<7:0> = 00000xxx=nop,
		00001xxx=rsvd,
		0001xxxx=rsvd, etc, etc

Printing:
	
	Support color postscript.

Trace format:	

	Support VCD+ Traces.

	Support LSI Traces. [Josh Belkin]

	Have pre-pruning to eliminate signals from .dmp files. [Ted Steubing]
