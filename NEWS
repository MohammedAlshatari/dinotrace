* Changes in Dinotrace 9.1b  2/13/2001

****	Documentation updates.


* Changes in Dinotrace 9.1a  1/22/2001

**	Added analog waveform format.  [Dave Colson]
	Includes new Signal Waveform menu and signal_waveform command.


* Changes in Dinotrace 9.0m  11/21/2000

****	Fixed a bug reading compressed tempest on Digital UNIX. [Steve Hoover]


* Changes in Dinotrace 9.0l  8/30/2000

**	Added support for femtosecond Verilog timescales. [Derek Bosch]


* Changes in Dinotrace 9.0k  7/17/2000

****	Fixed bug with $comment after $enddefinitions. [Harunobu Miyashita]

****	Fixed Tempest reading signals over 128 bits. [Ta-Chung Chang]
	This bug was introduced in 9.0i.

****	Fixed portability bug with Value Examine showing 0s. [Ta-Chung Chang]

****	Fixed Verilog reading with large time intervals. [Matthias Wenzel]


* Changes in Dinotrace 9.0i  5/1/2000

**	Major speed improvement in reading Tempest traces.
	All trace formats now have less processing when building busses from
	individual bits. [Steve Hoover]

***	ASCII traces assume extra time so last line is not lost.
	ASCII traces which had timestamps would not show the last state of the
	bus, as Dinotrace did not guess at how long that last state was valid for.
	Now, it looks at the smallest time step in the trace, and uses that
	as a guess at the timescale. [Pani Kodandapani]

****	Builds on NetBSD.  [Dan McMahill]


* Changes in Dinotrace 9.0g  1/17/2000

**	Configuration file commands that require times now take times
	with respect to the time_rep value.  Thus if the times are displayed
	in nanoseconds, the config file values are in ns.  This affects
	grid_resolution and grid_align.  Time_goto, resolution and cursor_add
	were already correct.

**	If a common prefix is present on every signal being displayed,
	then that prefix is no longer drawn, though it is still kept inside
	Dinotrace.  Drawing prefixes may be reenabled with a button in the
	Configure window, or with the draw_prefix configuration switch.
	[Dominik Strasser]

***	Value Examine (Mouse Button 2) now shows the value shifted to bit 0,
	if appropriate.  For example [10:3]=1 gets displayed also as [10:0]=8.

****	Fixed tempest files which start with phase b. [Steve Hoover]

****	Worked around a LessTif core dump when print menu appears.

****	Speedup when rereading large files with lots of deleted signals.

****    Fixed read followed by reread keep appending scope names. [George
	Varughese]

****    Fixed Verilog reading for TOPS traces. [Dieter Werth]


* Changes in Dinotrace 9.0f  9/29/1999

****	Allowed ' character in signals.  [Dominik Strasser]

****	Fixed a bug with vpd reading of vector length with #:#  [Dominik Strasser]

****	Fixed a bug which errored on "$timescale 10 ns"  (Space before units.)


* Changes in Dinotrace 9.0e  9/29/1999

****	Fixed a bug which would resize the screen incorrectly.

****	Fixed a postscript bug which would truncate the timestamps. [Rainer
	Mueller]

****	Latest LessTIF Fixed a bug which would omit cursor colors in scrollbar.

** Enhancements:

**	Signal Clear Highlight allows for unhighlighting all signals.

**	Signal Keep Highlight allows for deleting unhighlighted signals.

**	Customize Grid and grid_period allow placement of a grid on exactly
	each assertion, deassertion or both edges of a signal, rather then on
	a fixed time interval.

* Changes in Dinotrace 9.0d  11/30/1998

** Enhancements:

**	Signal Select now allows for deleting signals with X & Zs.

**	Signal Select now has two sorting functions.

***	Fixed bug with saving signal ordering and slow reread times. [Dan
	Lussier]

***	Added save_duplicates config command to avoid deleting verilog
	signals which occur many times.  [Dan Lussier]

***	Added hooks for linking other C programs to Dinotrace.  [Steve Hoover]

****	Fixed crash on Verilog Dumps.  [Lee Bradshaw]

****	Fixed crash with bad cursor X-11 error.  [Aki Niimura]

****	Fixed bug which would make Customize Grid ignore resolution setting.

* Changes in Dinotrace 9.0c  9/30/1998

** Enhancements:

****	Configures and builds on Windows NT.


* Changes in Dinotrace 9.0b  8/3/1998

** Enhancements:

**	Value Plus Dumps (aka VPD aka VCD+) are now supported by piping 
	through vpd2vcd.  Added supporting -vpd command line and
	file_format vpd configuration options.

****	Configures and builds on Linux.  [Celia Clause]


* Changes in Dinotrace 9.0a  4/13/1998

** Enhancements:

**	Added Customize Save As.  Saves a .dino file with controls for which
	pieces are saved.

** 	Values are now 4-state on a per-bit basis.  U's are still shown for
	mixed tristate/U busses, but value examine will show the true value.	

**	Added examination of grids, signal names, and cursors.  Added
	signal_note and cursor_add notes for passing messages to be seen
	with value examine.

**	Rewrote dinotrace.el to use the new verilog-mode.el and support more
	intelligent key bindings.	

***	Added many keyboard accelerators, cursor keys, etc.  Most are also
	usable in dinotrace.el

***	Signal names won't use up more then 1/3 of the width of the
	display.  A scroll bar was added to see names longer then this.

***	High boolean, or busses with all bits set now use a bolder line to aid
	in discriminating them from low signals.  Basic redrawing algorithm
	was rewritten to support better highlighting and better visibility
	when showing many changes in little space.

***	Added radix selection on a per-signal basis.  Added signal_radix
	command and Signal Radix menu.  Added ascii and real radixes.

***	Changed the order of parameters for configuration commands,
	to make them consistent with each other.  **This requires upgrading
	your .dino files.  The commands changed are value_highlight, signal_rename and
	value_highlight, and all cursor_* commands.

***	Added hierarchy_separator for aligning signal names, and annotation.	

***	Added trace selection to Value Annotate.	

****	Added -IGNORE_XZ to signal_delete_constant.

****	Print has moved to the trace menu, since most programs have it under the
	first menu item.	

****	Most popups now use forms, for cleaner looks with larger fonts.

** First version distributed outside Digital:

**	Dinotrace now uses GNU configure.  It compiles clean on Sun
	Solaris 5.5.1.  Added texinfo documents for manual, FAQ, and
	installation.

**	Verilog is now the default format.  This includes the default
	vector_seperator being now "[" to coincide with Verilog.  If you
	are using another format (such as tempest), you will have to
	override it.

***	Removed Digital Internal vtrace and cvtbin programs.  Removed old
	-siz and -pos flags (use -geometry instead.)

****	Many source code changes to aid readability and maintainabily.  The
	main trace data structure changed to support true 4-state and to
	allow future enhancements.  This required modifing all trace
	reading routines, so latent bugs may cause values to be
	mis-displayed.


* Changes in Dinotrace 8.3b  9/12/1997

***	Allowed colors in signal_add, signal_move, signal_rename, signal_copy.
	[Duane Galbi]


* Changes in Dinotrace 8.3a  1/29/1997

***	Allowed value searches to specify a signal name to search in.
	[Lisa Noack]

***	Made save signal ordering be on by default.

***	Added signal_rename command.  [Julie Staraitis]

***	Added the full documentation to Help menu option.


* Changes in Dinotrace 8.2b  11/07/1996

****	Fixed a bug which would cause a common bus to be made containing
	two unrelated signals.  [Serge Bogdanov]


* Changes in Dinotrace 8.2  10/10/1996

***	Added support for 3-state COSMOS traces.  [Serge Bogdanov]


* Changes in Dinotrace 8.1e  7/24/1996

****	Fixed a bug where reading a directory as a config file would
	crash, rather then warn.  [Steve Lang]

****	Fixed a bug where annotation would add many leading zeros.
	[Rachel Berman]


* Changes in Dinotrace 8.1c  5/20/1996

****	Fixed a bug where signal_add would add signals from any trace,
	not just from deleted signals.  (Use signal_copy to add signals
	from any trace including deleted signals.)  [Michael Quadri]


* Changes in Dinotrace 8.1b  4/30/1996

****	Fixed a bug where deleting signals would make the top signals in
	a trace disappear.  [Steve Lang]


* Changes in Dinotrace 8.1a  3/27/1996

***	Added a customize read option, and allowed selection of which
	.dino files are read automatically with traces.  [Mike Kagen]

***	Added a tempest format which stores data only when signals change.
	This greatly reduces file sizes.  This new format is created by
	Verilator, still called a .bt, and automatically detected by
	Dinotrace.  [Paul Wasson]

***	Added decimal bus representations.

****	Made several speedups to reading ASCII based traces.  Verilog is
	now 32% faster, Decsim 17%.  [Reinhard Schumann]

	Deleting and adding signals with long names will now narrow and
	widen the space set aside for signal names automatically.

	Fixed a bug which leaked about 1MB every file read.  [Mike Kagen]


* Changes in Dinotrace 8.0e  3/8/1996

****	Fixed a bug where refresh in a configuration file would crash
	Dinotrace.  [Sol Katzman]



* Changes in Dinotrace 8.0d  3/6/1996

***	Increased the number of states on a signal to 512.  [Mike Kagen,
	Yifat Ben-Shachar]

****	Fixed a bug which would mis-print busses over 32 bits wide.  [Steve
	Glaser]


* Changes in Dinotrace 8.0c  3/4/1996

**	Massively improved grid support, especially for multi-clock
	designs.  The grid item is no longer on the main menu, all
	functions are now under Customize Grid.  You can now choose which
	signal to grid, and have up to 4 grids at once.  The colors and
	alignment options are also now selectable.  See above for the new
	grid configuration commands.  In the process, also fixed a bug that
	would cause grid time stamps to be off one tick at the beginning of
	traces.  [Rachel Berman, Steve Glaser]  Dinotrace now calculates
	the period from the LAST assertions in the file, thus eliminating
	clock start-up effects.  [Mike Kagen]

**	When rereading a trace, Dinotrace will now attempt to keep the
	signal position the same.  Previously, the trace would jump up
	vertically to the first signal when rereading.  [Paul Chan]

**	Added reading a configuration file that is read from DINOCONFIG:
	(VMS) or the DINOCONFIG enviornment variable (OSF).  This is useful
	for session specific start-up, like setting screen size depending
	on what type of system you are using.  [Steve Glaser]

***	Changed the print requester to allow greater flexability in setting
	the start and end print times.  Also, will now print the value
	instead of just leaving a blank space if a signal_state is too wide
	to be printed. [Steve Glaser]

***	Added support for displaying 128 bit busses on one line, instead of
	the previous scheme of displaying them as two lines.

***	Added the resolution configuration command to change screen
	resolutions, just like the Res button.

****	Fixed a bug where listing a enable signal after the data signal in
	a verilog .tra file would crash Dinotrace.  [Paul Chan]

****	Fixed drawing overlapping numbers when cursors were too close.

****	Fixed a bug with deleting constant signals that are no longer
	constant on rereads.  [Mike Kagen]

****	Fixed a bug which crashed Dinotrace after reading a corrupted trace
	file.  [Dan Katz]

****	Fixed a bug reading ASCII chango which would create a random "SIG 0"
	when the file had a leading space.

****	Fixed a bug which misdrew signals when they were added after
	scrolling the main window. [Sol Katzman]

****	Fixed a bug which crashed Dinotrace when scrolling with a
	grid on odd signal boundaries.  [Sol Katzman]



* Changes in Dinotrace 7.4a  2/01/1996

**	Added time, value, and signal font selection (see resource
	section.)  [Steve Lang]

***	When real numbers are found in Verilog traces a warning is printed
	rather then a indecipherable error message.  [Reinhard Schumann]

***	Values in the trace window now use lower case letters when printing
	hex.  This mainly makes it easier to discriminate "E" and "F".



* Changes in Dinotrace 7.3b  12/04/1995

***	Added support for Merlin binary traces (tempest format).  [Dan Katz]

****	Fixed a preservation bug.  When order preservation was turned on,
	if a signal was deleted because it was a constant, then a new trace
	read in which had the signal changing, the new signal would be
	deleted.  Now it will detect this case and not delete the signal.



* Changes in Dinotrace 7.3a  12/04/1995

**	Dinotrace will attempt to preserve signal colors, ordering, and
	deletions when re-reading a trace.  This is controllable with the
	save_ordering command and button on the file open window. [Ed
	Arthur, Steve Kolecki, et al]

**	Added manual refreshing, useful for dialup eXcursion.  Added
	related refresh, and refreshing commands.  Added refresh button
	near End button.  [Reinhard Schumann]


* Changes in Dinotrace 7.2b  10/29/1995

***	Added the signal_add command.  [Reinhard Schumann]

***	Decsim traces now allow '?' as unknows to support the Nextest
	trace format.  [Josh Belkin]


* Changes in Dinotrace 7.2a  10/4/1995

***	Value Annotation now has seperate enables for automatic cursors,
	which default to off.

***	Added a parity calculation message to the Value Annotate window.
	[Bob Yodlowski]

****	Fixed a bug where Verilog DMPs with over 1024 bit busses would
	core dump.  [Dean Sovie]



* Changes in Dinotrace 7.1c  6/28/1995

**	Files ending in .Z or .gz will now be uncompressed or ungnuzip'ed
	respectively.  This results in large disk space savings.

***	Multiple trace files can now be specified on the command line.  All
	will be read in to independent trace windows on startup.  [Paul
	Wasson]

***	Added a warning when the timescale is too large in Verilog DMP files.
	[Yifat Ben-Shachar]

****	Fixed a bug which would make commands after Value Highlight behave
	strangely.

****	Fixed a bug where signal searching with the first color couldn't be
	turned off.  [Charlie Lind]

****	Fixed a bug where characters after the bus name would be truncated.
	[Paul Wasson]



* Changes in Dinotrace 7.1a  5/24/1995

**	Added a socket interface for Emacs (Ultrix/OSF only).  This allows
	Emacs to feed configuration commands, such as cursor placements, to
	Dinotrace on-the-fly.  See dinotrace.el for more information.
	Added the time_goto, signal_goto, and annotate configuration
	commands.

***	Added the Value Highlight command. [Mike Kagen]

***	Added many keyboard accelerators, see KEYBOARD section above.
	[Paul Wasson]

***	The center mouse button now always does value examine.  The first
	button has the same functionality as before.  [Many]

***	If a value is too small to print, a "?" will be printed instead,
	presuming that the ? will fit.  This allows highlighted values
	(with value search) to be seen.  Value Examine (MB2) can then be
	used to see the exact value.

****	The resolution change button is now of constant size.  [Bob
	Yodlowski]

****	Fixed a bug where printscreen would cause "Implementation limit
	exceeded" printer errors in traces with undefined values.  [Bill
	Bruce]

****	Fixed a bug where signals of over 96 bits in Verilog DMP files
	would show up as blank.  [Ben Marshall]


* Changes in Dinotrace 7.0c  2/20/1995

****	Fixed a bug where highlighting wouldn't happen when the same value
	was in multiple colors in the value search requester.  [Mike Kagen]
	

* Changes in Dinotrace 7.0b  2/20/1995

***	Added -noconfig command line option.

****	Fixed a performance bug when reading Verilog Dump files.  [Tracey
	Jones]



* Changes in Dinotrace 7.0a  2/20/1995

**	Added the annotation feature and Emacs library.  Any behavioral
	code debuggers should look at this feature!!

***	Added the signal_delete and signal_delete_constant configuration
	commands.  [Paul Wasson]

***	Added the delete constant value button in the signal select requester.

***	Added a configuration command for using two different grids on
	rising and falling edges.

***	Changed the printout to dynamically compute the width of signal
	names.  This will prevent signal names from being chopped off from
	the left margin of printouts.  [Josh Belkin]

***	Tempest format traces will have the cycle count multiplied by one,
	not two which was the prior default.  This can be overridden by
	time_multiplier.  [Paul Wasson]

***	Placing one cursor over another cursor will now delete the older
	cursor.  Cursors added in configuration files are now dotted,
	and will disappear when the configuration is re-read.

****	Fixed a bug which would not display tempest signals over 96 bits.
	Setting the signal separator to non '<' will now break up tempest
	signals.

****	Fixed a bug which would not accept #2 subscripts on signals
	in DECSIM ASCII traces.  [Dave Horan]

****	Fixed a bug which would not refresh the trace when the window was
	resized.


* Changes in Dinotrace 6.7  10/05/1994

***	This release is the first to include an Alpha-VMS executable.
	*** PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS CHANGES THE FILENAMES OF THE KIT AND
	EXECUTABLES. The file dinotrace.exe is now named dinotrace_vv.exe,
	and is distributed as a save set.

***	Changed the print requester to add the include-off-screen options.
	[Bob Walsh]

***	Added the cursor_add and signal_highlight configuration commands.
	[Tom Hunt]

***	Added support for Verilator/CCLI tristates.  (See the Verilator
	manual.)

***	Added ... to those menu items that pop up requesters.

***	Rewrote the ASCII Trace header reader to remove limitations on
	the number of signals, and length of signal names.

***	Auto grid setting now works on Tempest files.  Previously it would
	set the grid based upon phase_count.  Now it is set based upon the
	second signal in the trace.

***	Removed a old pre-4.2 limitation on the number of traced signals in a
	tempest file.  [Simcha]

****	Fixed a bug where Alpha OSF systems would pop-up windows that were
	too small to contain all of the widgets.

****	Fixed a bug which caused page increments of other then one to
	not work.  [Larry Herman]

****	Fixed a bug where some X-servers would crash when large traces were
	displayed on the screen.  [Charlie Lind]


* Changes in Dinotrace 6.6  5/23/1994

***	This release is the first to include an Alpha-OSF executable.

***	The Decsim ASCII reader now also understands traces produced
	by Chango.  Chango Binary is not supported.

***	Added an EPS (Encapsulated Postscript) option to printscreen for
	making figures for inclusion in other documents.  [David Chen]

***	Added resources to change the screen colors.  Changed the
	background color under every other signal to aid in readability.
	(Like the old green-barred paper.)  [Larry Gust]

***	Inside the print dialogue, hitting return in the filename window
	has the same action as hitting the print button.  [Mitch Norcross]

***	The limit of 512 signals in a Decsim Ascii trace has been removed.
	All formats are now limited only by memory availability.  [Josh
	Belkin]

****	Fixed a bug where the -res option on the command line would crash
	Dinotrace.  [Erik Debriae]

****	Fixed a bug where clicking on OK in File Open without selecting a
	file would hang.  [Larry Gust]



* Changes in Dinotrace 6.5  1/10/1994

**	Added Trace->Reread All which will reread the trace in every
	window.  To support this Trace->Reread will now only read a trace
	if that trace has changed, otherwise it will do nothing.  The time
	the trace was created can now be seen under the new Help -> On
	Trace menu item.

***	Added a -geometry to the command line to support the X standard.
	The now redundant -siz and -pos flags remain for compatibility, but
	will be removed in the next release.  Added start_geometry,
	open_geometry, and shrink_geometry to config files to support
	different personal preferences.  [Mitch Norcross]

***	A optional feature was added that will cause Cursors and Grids to
	be snapped to a signal edge within 20 pixels of the cursor.  Added
	a toggle button and click_to_edge configuration command to support
	this.

***	Added a note field to print requester.  Any information entered
	will be printed on the postscript print.  Changed the B-Sized
	postscript to spread out the page number at the bottom.

***	Moved the file format selector that was under the Customize Change
	menu to the File Open Menu.  Added Decsim Compressed ASCII format
	on Ultrix only (since VMS can support Decsim Binary), and
	corresponding -decsim_z switch to command line.  [Bob McNamara]

***	Added a signal select requester, which allows specific signals to
	be chosen off from a list of signals.  Also allows signals matching
	a pattern to be selected.  [Simcha]

***	Dinotrace will automatically zoom out to show the entire trace, when
	the first trace is read in after starting Dinotrace or selecting
	Trace Clear, just as if the "full" button was pressed.  [Paul
	Dormitzer]

***	Added picoseconds and microseconds to the time representation
	customize window, and the time_rep configure command.  Added the
	time_precision and time_format configure commands.  These may be
	used to view traces with better then 1 ns precision.  Made Verilog
	format detect the time resolution of the trace automatically.
	[Paul Dormitzer]

***	A bug was fixed which would put error and information windows up on
	the incorrect trace window.  A bug was fixed where a signal that
	was copied would have its name change when the trace was reread.  A
	bug was fixed in Decsim Binary which would show a signal as the
	wrong assertion until the first time it changed in the trace.
	[John Murphy]



* Changes in Dinotrace 6.4  11/18/1993

***	The major change in this release is in reading files.  Verilog
	format is supported, and Tempest format now works correctly.
	Decsim binary reading has been speeded up by some 200-300%.

**	Added support for Verilog DMP traces.  [Edward Arthur, et. al.] See
	the instructions above for special information on using dumps.

**	Added Signal->Search, which searches for a signal name, possibly
	including wild cards.  [Mitch Norcross, Lauren Carlson] Added color
	bars to the vertical signal scroll bar that shows highlighted
	signals, similar to the cursors in the horizontal time slider.

***	Eliminated glitches in displaying Tempest format traces.  [Ronen
	Boneh] 	Added "file_format" command to configuration files, and
	button to configuration menu.  I suggest putting the line
	"file_format tempest" in the DINODISK:dinotrace.dino rather then
	having to always use the dinotrace -tempest command line switch.
	Tempest files with tristates are not supported; I do not know of a
	program which generates tempest tristates.

***	Added a "vector_seperator" configuration command which will allow
	signals that use symbols other then "<#>" to separate the names of
	signals from their bit subscripts.  [Paul Dormitzer] The
	vectorization routine now always displays the correct subscripts,
	surrounded by angle brackets, even if a tempest trace file did not
	have them.  Dinotrace also now supports little endian (<0:10>)
	vectors.  [Josh Belkin]

***	Added a "print_size" configuration command.  Made the print size
	affect all traces that are open, rather than each trace
	individually.

***	The .dino configuration files used to be read after the trace
	itself.  These files are now read before the trace.  This allows
	commands such as vector_seperator and file_format to take affect on
	the file that is being read.

****	Fixed a bug which would place a cursor at the wrong position when
	using goto with a position near the end of the trace.  [Mike Blake]
	Fixed a bug where Trace->Open, Trace->Read, Trace->ReRead would
	crash Dinotrace.  [Jai Singh]



* Changes in Dinotrace 6.3  8/11/1993

**	A new top level value menu was created to effect and search on the
	value of signals.  Signal Search has been moved to Value Search.  A
	new Value Examine has been added to aid in determining which bits
	are set on large busses, and to determine values when the space is
	too small to display the value inside the signal's waveform.

***	The goto button now has a option menu to place a cursor at the
	value entered. [Mike Blake]

***	It is now acceptable to click Zoom in one window and click on two
	points in another window.

***	Fixed a bug where Ultrix printouts had a incorrect date.  [Edward
	Arthur]

****	Fixed a bug where a bus of over 96 bits used to hang Dinotrace.
	Dinotrace now splits busses of over 96 bit into multiple lines on
	the screen.

****	Fixed a buf where Reading Binary traces which had times over 537,000
	ns would cause the screen to fill with garbage. (All times
	in binary and ASCII traces must still be under 2,000,000,000 ns.)


* Changes in Dinotrace 6.2  5/14/1993

**	The time scroll bar (horizontal) now shows the position of cursors
	that are not on the screen.  This makes it easy to quickly scroll
	to the position of the next cursor.

***	Dinotrace now uses the logical or environment variable DINODISK,
	not DINO$DISK, as in the previous versions.  This provides
	compatibility between the VMS and Unix versions.

***	A goto button has been added next to the begin button.  Pressing it
	will prompt for the time or cycle number, and then center that time
	on the screen.  [Mitch Norcross]

***	The signal search requester now has 2 buttons for each search
	button.  The first is the same as before, and will highlight any
	display value that equals the value entered.  The new second button
	will add a cursor at the time where the value begins.  Cursors that
	are placed in this fashion are temporary, and will go away if the
	search value is changed.  Highlighting or moving a cursor makes it
	permanent; it will not go away when the search changes.  Likewise
	deleting a cursor that was placed automatically will still cause
	the cursor to reappear when the search is requested again.

***	Pressing return when entering a signal search value has the same
	function as hitting "OK".  [Mitch Norcross]

***	Added A/B sized page selector to the printscreen requester.  Added
	version help option to menu.  Time can now be displayed in
	nanoseconds (as before), or in number of cycles.  Cycles are
	determined based on the grid position and resolution.  (Cycle
	counting is useful for performance analysis.)

***	The Trace Open menu option now automatically does a Trace Read in the
	new window.  [Mitch Norcross]

****	Fixed a configuration file bug where a ", }" would cause the next
	line in the file to be skipped.  [Mitch Norcross]

****	Improved handling of color on Unix systems.

****	Added Verilog information and VTRACE to Documentation.  [Written
	by Gregg Bouchard]


* Changes in Dinotrace 6.1  4/12/1993

**	Added keyboard accelerators.  The keyboard may be used to select
	menu options when the mouse is over the menu by pressing the
	underlined character in the menus.  If the mouse is not over the
	menu, hold the Compose-Character key while pressing the underlined
	letter, then release and press the sub-menu letter.  [Derrick
	Dacosta]

***	Added a signal copy option.  As with signal move, a copied signal
	will be erased when the trace it came from is closed or reread.
	[Mike Goulet]

***	Changed signal highlight so that the color is chosen from a menu,
	rather then being toggled when a signal is clicked on.  Added a
	similar function, cursor highlight.  [Lauren Carlson]

***	Hard coded the color selection values to be the specific colors:
	Window Foreground, White, Red, ForestGreen, Blue, Magenta, Cyan,
	Yellow, Salmon, and NavyBlue.

***	Allowed lower case "z" or "U" in decsim ascii traces to support
	Verilog.  [Gregg Bouchard]


* Changes in Dinotrace 6.0  4/6/1993

	This is a major release with many new features, so read up!

**	The major new feature is multiple trace support.  The Trace Open
	menu option will shrink the current window in half, and open
	another window.  Two traces may then be viewed together, and they
	will move together and share cursors, etc.  Trace Close closes the
	current trace.  Trace Clear closes all other windows and resets
	Dinotrace as if you exited and then ran Dinotrace again.  These
	options are intended for traces that were made together; using it
	with traces that are of different lengths is buggy.

**	Added Signal Searching to simplify finding data that is dropped on
	the floor due to bugs.  Allows 9 values to be specified which will
	be searched for in the trace.  Each value is entered into a text
	widget and the toggle button to the left is activated.  Anywhere
	that the value appears in a trace, the value will be printed using
	the color of the toggle button.  There is currently a bug that
	causes the colors that are used to be somewhat random, and on some
	machined black.

**	Converted user interface to OSF/Motif (which fixed the file
	selector bug).

***	Updated support for Ultrix version.  Because binary traces use
	VMS's RMS, binary traces are not supported in the Ultrix version.
	[Gregg Bouchard]

***	Added different cursors for each mode.  Neatened internal code.
	Removed screen number switch, as it was non-functional (use set
	display).

***	Added Signal Highlight menu option for highlighting a signal and
	its trace.  For now it only alternates between the foreground color
	and white.

***	To make it easier to compare two windows with different traces the
	resolution now stays constant when resizing the window, and
	resizing makes more or fewer cycles visible.  The resolution of a
	trace used to change during resizing such that the time range being
	displayed stayed constant, and the screen was magnified or shrunk.

***	Cursors, resolution, and the current position in time are
	preserve across traces.  If they are setup and the trace is reread,
	they will be in the same place as before.

****	Fixed a bug which would cause Dinotrace to crash when using very
	large (dense) resolutions.  Now if a signal is very dense, it may
	end part way across the screen.  (Not perfect, but beats crashing.)
	[Mike Goulet]



* Changes in Dinotrace 5.2b  3/11/1993

***	Re-release to fix bug where move signal would crash Dinotrace when
	using binary traces.  Changed "Dinotrace V5.0" to "5.2" in
	postscript printing.


* Changes in Dinotrace 5.2  2/17/1993

**	The main new feature is Binary Traces.  Dinotrace now can read
	either binary or ascii traces, and it automatically determines
	which type is being read.  Binary traces should normally be used as
	they consume less disk space and are less CPU Time intensive.

***	The screen now clears at the beginning of reading a new file to
	make it more obvious when the new data has been loaded.  A main
	part of the reading algorithm calculated exponentials.  This was
	removed, resulting in ~50% speed up on reading large vectored
	traces.

***	Two new resolution changing gadgets were added:

	    zoom:	(Text box to RIGHT of number box) Click on two time
		points.  Expands the trace so that the time between the
		clicks occupies the entire screen.  [Mitch Norcross]

	    full:	(Text box to LEFT of number box) Shrinks the time
		so that the entire trace fits onto the screen.  [Mitch
		Norcross]
	
****	A bug where canceling the read requester would erase the trace has
	been fixed.

****	If a vector was not constructed correctly, for example if it
	consists of <25:3,3,2:1> with either missing or duplicate tag
	values, the bus will not be combined.  Previously they would be
	assumed to be in order, which could cause misinterpretation.

****	If a statename is too wide to print, the number will be printed
	instead.  Previously nothing would be printed.



* Changes in Dinotrace 5.1

***	Dinotrace now supports state machines with up to 96 states, rather
	the the 64 allowed earlier.

****	Fixed a bug which would prevent printouts from working when printing
	times over 10,000.  [Jai Singh]



* Changes in Dinotrace 5.0  1/11/1993

***	You may now specify a filename on the command line that will be
	read when Dinotrace starts up.

***	The title in the icon now represents the file that Dinotrace is
	displaying.  This makes it much simpler when many Dinotrace icons
	are on the screen at once.

***	The main window interface has been made consistent with Motif
	standards.  The scroll bar unit and page increments were made
	consistent.  The resolution increase and decrease buttons were
	swapped.  Wide signal widths are no longer truncated.

***	Trace ReRead was added.  [Lauren Carlson]

***	Customize ReRead and Restore were added.  The entire customization
	file and signal_states features were added.


* Changes in Dinotrace 4.2

	Versions prior to 5.0 were by Allen Gallotta.

***	Created VMS link procedure
***	Signal add dialog box retains focus when adding signals
***	Added a check for #2's in trace file

****	Fixed signal right justification on printscreen
****	Fixed printing of 'wide' bus values on printscreen
****	Fixed 'wide' bus representation of signals not a multiple of
	  32 bits wide, both on screen and printscreen
****	Fixed bus string compares
****	Fixed last signal always deleted when using cursors
****	Fixed crash when resolution was set too high

****	Known bug: will crash in File->Select when filtering with long
	filters ( toolkit problem??? )
